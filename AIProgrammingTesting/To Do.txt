Done:
	*DONE: CLEAN UP THE CODEBASE SO IT CAN ACTUALLY BE WORKED WITH! PRIO 1, PRIO UNO!
	*DONE: PRINT TEXT: Implement a way to prin text so that one can follow the number of killed agents in real time, without waiting	
	*DONE: Implement "range" between agents ("x" value implemented)
	*DONE: Implement "real" weapons (NO MORE RANDOM STATS!).
		*SEMI DONE: Random a weapon for each entity, but create from a list of weapons (weaponhandler?)
	*SEMI DONE: Implement "accuracy modification" for agents
	*SEMI DONE: Implement movement (very basic as of now)
To do:
	-Clean Up the codebase every now and then.
	-Refactor D2D class so that the write part is outside of the D2D class?
	-Implement "scrolling window" so that the simulation can be less "zoomed out"
	-Implement decision algorithms (should I attack, OR heal? Are none of them a threat to me? Should I move towards an agent?)
	-Implement "hiding" spots
	-Implement removal of hiding spots
	-Implement a real map, let the agents find each other and shoot
	-Implement line of sight / detection

AIs to test and implement (in non-specific order)
	-Finite State Machine
	-Decision Tree
	-Behavioural Tree
	-CBR (learn from other AIs?)

To look at:
	-Fuzzy Logic
