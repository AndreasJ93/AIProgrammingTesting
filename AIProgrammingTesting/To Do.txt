To do:
	-Implement "range" between agents
	-Implement "scrolling window" so that the simulation can be less "zoomed out"
	-Implement "real" weapons (NO MORE RANDOM STATS!).
		-Random a weapon for each entity, but create from a list of weapons (weaponhandler?)
	-Implement "accuracy modification" for agents
	-Implement decision algorithms (should I attack, OR heal? Are none of them a threat to me? Should I move towards an agent?)
	-Implement movement and "hiding" spots
	-Implement removal of hiding spots
	-Implement a real map, let the agents find each other and shoot
	-Implement line of sight / detection

AIs to test and implement (in non-specific order)
	-CBR (learn from other AIs?)
	-Finite State Machine
	-Decision Tree
	-Behavioural Tree

To look at:
	-Fuzzy Logic
